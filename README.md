# Bass-machine

WIP vst synthesizer written in rust.

Based on my Graintable-synth project.
This project is more meant to suit my personal bass needs, since all synths I've tried fall short in one way or another.
Goal for now is 4 wavetable oscillators that can FM each other however you want them to


Features planned:
* Stereo processing. Mostly for unison/potential effects
* Modulation framework (envelopes done, next step adding destinations)
* Nonlinear state variable filter (almost done)
* FM 
* Glide/portamento
* More wavetables
